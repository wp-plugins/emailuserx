A very simple plugin to email your users.

== Description ==
Since it seemed like <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/email-users/">Email Users</a> doesnt work for 2.7+, this
is the replacement.  It is simple to use, basically just install, select some users (or all of them) and send the email. 
For support, goto <a href="http://code.google.com/p/suitex/">http://code.google.com/p/suitex/</a>.


== Installation ==

1. Upload the emailuserx directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Under "Manage" in the Administration area, select your users, type your message, and send away.
